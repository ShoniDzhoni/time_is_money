# Time Is Money

__See how many hours you have to work to afford all that crap you want.__

*Time Is Money* is a Chrome Web Extension I built to curb my Amazon window-shopping, and to put off studying for finals.

Enter your hourly wage in Options and the extension will convert the prices you see on the web into hours you'd have to work to earn that much.
