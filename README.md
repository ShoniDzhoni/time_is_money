# Time Is Money

### Spend it wisely.

Why do we want money? Sometimes it's because we really want that new BluRay player, or tickets to that Broadway show, or a pair of fly new kicks. But usually we want money so we can have time to do what we love. We put in overtime for a few months so we can take a two week adventure in Southeast Asia. We slave away at the office for decades in exchange for a relaxing retirement. For our whole lives, we spend our time trying to earn it back.

You can't get back time you've spent, but you can make decisions today that save you time tomorrow. [Download Time Is Money](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/time-is-money/ooppbnomdcjmoepangldchpmjhkeendl) and start saving hours like dollars.
